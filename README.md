# File API Dump

"**F**ile API **Dump**"

This project observes which files are opened when using file input/output APIs.

## How to work

High-level classes (File, FileOutputStream, BufferedReader, etc.) â†’ Low-level system calls (open(), read(), write())
High-level APIs abstract file operations to make them easier for users to handle. However, internally, they ultimately use the Linux open() system call to open the file.
